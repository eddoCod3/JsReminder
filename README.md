## Why i built JsReminder
+ Some times i dont know what to do and having some options at hand it is good
+ I wanted to practice the fundamentals (html,css, js)
+ Use the Whatshapp api and send messages


This is a  simple web app  desing to give you 
some ideas to do in your spare time

also if you want to send the reminder to your phone via whatshap you can do that

##  Change phone number


+if you want to send a message to your personal phone change the  ${phone_number}
to the international telephone number like the whatshap documentation says

example
use: 232134543290

if you want more information about the phone number and the international format check the 
whatshap documentation
https://faq.whatsapp.com/425247423114725/?helpref=uf_share

or search international format (your country) in google

## What do do Next
+[] Improve the documentation
+[] Add a more quick way to send the message
+[] Add more emojis (optional)
